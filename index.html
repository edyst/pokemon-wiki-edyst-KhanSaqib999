	<h2 style="font-size: 45px; color: white;" align="center"> Q and A</h2>
	<p><b>Questions Every Pokemon Trainer Should Be Able To Answer</b></p>
	<ol>
	   <b><li>What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</li></b>
	   <div class="ans">
		   <ul>
		   <li> We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every trainer, but <br> you should also be well versed in the rodent's evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger evolved form also capable of <br> generating vast amounts of electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild. Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers <br> should be able to answer.</li>
		   <li>Answer is Raichu</li>
			   </ul>
		   </div>
		   <br>
		   <b><li>What's the most effective Poke Ball in the game?</li></b>
		   <div class="ans">
		   <ul>
			   <li>Not all Poke Balls are made equally. There's the basic model you start your journey off with, but progressive upgrades are needed if you're <br> looking to keep up with some of the stronger wild Pokemon who emerge in later routes. If you've made your way through any Pokemon game,<br> you've reached the point where you're presented with the most effective Poke Ball known to man. This is a one shot catch, and no button <br> mashing at all is required.</li>
			   <li>Answer is Master Ball</li>
